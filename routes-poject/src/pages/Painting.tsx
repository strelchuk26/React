            <p>
            “Guernica” is not only Picasso's best-known work, it's one of the most famous paintings in the world. Its depiction of an aerial bombing raid on the Basque town of Guernica in April 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, was an eerie visual prelude to the coming atrocities of World War II.
